              sourcing. AI is the most repeated solution by every tech
              wizard. Adoption of AI is impossible by the manufacturing
              company. Reading this primer will explain the difficulties.
              However, automation solutions promising AI is the only way
              to exploit artificial intelligence. Utthunga evidently is such a
              company we are glad to introduce.
              Indian manufacturing only hopes of competing globally is

                <p>For many people, Artificial
                  Intelligence (AI) means robots
                  performing complex human tasks
                  in sci-fi movies. Actually, it is partially
                  true. Whatever AI offers to the world is
                  allowing the indutralmachines to carry
                  out superintelligent tasks. As the global
                  industries and decision makers are
                  facing new challenges, thereis an urgent
                  requirement to propel manufacturing
                  by using the most advanced technologies.
                  Industries need to restructure &
                  revamp their control systems and other
                  industrial assets (software or hardware) in order to keep pace with the unprecedented
                  speed of change. Artificial
                  Intelligence or AI could potentially
                  help meet these goals. AI applications
                  are already becoming pervasive in
                  industries like banking, gaming, retail,
                  entertainment and more. The fourth
                  industrial revolution is driven by new
                  ways of automating the industrial tasks
                  with smarter sensors, controllers, IO
                  modules, PLCs, gateways, enterprise
                  systems, etc. and restructuring the ways
                  humans and machines interact to create
                  a stronger digital ecosystem.</p>

              With the growing changes in the customer
              behavior in regard to product
              quality and customization, it is difficult
              for the businesses to make changes in
              their system. That is where Machine
              Learning (ML) benefits the industries.
              ML is a subset of AI and empowers
              the computers to learn automatically
              from the data inputs and applies
              that information without any human
              intervention. ML aids in optimizing the
              production and supply chain efficiency,

                entertainment, to name a few. However,
                the more we trust this new technology
                to take important decisions, the higher
                is the chance for large-scale errors. To
                prevent such errors, we must understand
                how and why AI reaches certain
                conclusions. The two terms which come
                up in the mind while thinking about
                improving AI are:</p>

            <p>After being a distant aspiration for
              the industries for many years, we
              are now more close to adoption and
              meaningful ROI of AI systems in the
              industrial landscape. As we see above,
              the potential advantage of AI adoption
              into the industrial ecosystem are
              huge. However, the articulation of the
              problem statements and the mapping of
              the right AI tools/technologies to these
              problem statements is fraught with
              several challenges. Internal champions
              (in the plant floor and above) and
              external technology providers have to
              collaborate deeply. The promise is there,
              the execution is the key. Surely, some of
              these technologies will get even more
              mature and “easy” to use with time,
              but choosing to wait and delay implementation
              will lead to a competitive
              handicap. Industries should act now,
              start small, but start now. Utthunga is a
