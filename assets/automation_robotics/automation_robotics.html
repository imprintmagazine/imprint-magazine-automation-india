              This chapter
              organizes and
              takes stock of
              the current state of
              the global industrial
              robotics market and
              its key characteristics.
              The resulting
              overview serves
              as a backdrop for
              understanding
              the driving factors
              behind the industry’s
              expected growth
              and how it will come
              about.
            </p>
            <p class="box">Traditional robotics will evolve
              with artificial intelligents. Robotics
              applications and industrial manufacturing
              will become intelligent. Evidently Indian manufacturing
              has defaulted. Large scale manufacturing is
              going to be adopted in India. Demand; Consumption; Market;
              Pricing; Retal; are all in place. Robotics will become
              the primary ingredient for large scale manufacturing.
              So, dear readers of imprint automation India
              magazine this business opportunity is
              crystalized. Stay tuned. Cheers!</p>

          <h4 class="subheading">Overview of products and market segments</h4>
          <hr>

          <div class="subheadingtext">
            <div class="inner-text">
              <p>Unlike the automotive and other
                machinery industries, McKinsey
                designates industrial robotics as
                “low volume, high complexity.” The
                low-volume designation is related
                to the relatively small number of
                machines that are produced and
                deployed within each specification.
                Two realities characterize the high
                complexity of the industrial robotics
                sector: first, the breadth of different
                machine types that can be included
                under the umbrella is massive, just
                in the sheer number of machine
                types. Second, there is also great
                variety when it comes to the size,
                technology, and application areas of
                robots. Amid this lack of uniformity
                or common control systems in the
                robotics industry, it is important to
                establish a common understanding
                of and terminology for the scope
                covered before analyzing and
                interpreting both the end users’ and
                sector’s perspectives and outlook.
                For this whitepaper, we have leveraged
                McKinsey’s definitions and
                categorizations of industrial robots
                – comprising four subcategories, of
                which the first is further divided into four segments (see Table 1) – and
                automation cells and solutions (see
                Table 2)</p>

                exclusively without direct

                They are usually fixed (i.e.,

          <h4 class="subheading">Collaborative robots</h4>
          <div class="subheadingtext">
            <div class="inner-text">
              <p>While collaborative robots are still a
                nascent market with about 10,000
                to 20,000 units shipped in 2017,
                analysts expect strong future growth
                with more than 100,000 units to be
                shipped in 2020. The key difference
                between collaborative and standalone
                robots is that collaborative
                robots do not need safety fences
                for safe operations. Onboard safety
                mechanisms and a process design
                that enables collocation and collaboration
                allow these robots to operate
                directly and safely alongside
                human workers. These built-in safety
                mechanisms reduce the need for
                external safety measures, such as
                fencing and interlock for entry, thus
                reducing installation design costs.
                Collaborative robots can be simpler
                to apply, connect, and run. Quite often,
                these are single robot installations
                with simple and discrete input/
                output interfaces that lower installation
                and programming costs. Collaborative
                robots provide an advantage
                wherever workers benefit from
                physical support – for example, by
                improving process ergonomics and
                potentially giving older workers or
                workers with restricted physical
                ability the assistance they need to
                be successful in manufacturing. The
                automotive and electronics sectors
                are where collaborative robots are
                currently deployed the most and
                used not only for incidental work
                (such as materials handling) but also for value adding (such as assembly).
                In logistics, however, this
                robotics category has application in
                value-added tasks (such as picking)
                and supportive work (such as kitting
                and pre-retail services).</p>

            <div class="inner-text">
              <p>Mobile robots – also known as
                automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
                – can be used in a range of applications,
                including warehouses and
                distribution centers, manufacturing
                intralogistics, agriculture, and other
                environments (especially in logistics
                in hospitals or retail). There are also
                first models and prototypes for domestic
                use. Expectations for AGVs
                are high. IFR estimates that 69,000
                logistics systems had been installed
                in 2017 (63% of total professional

            <p>Exoskeletons, or human-robot
              hybrids, are robots connected to the
              human body to support heavy-duty
              process steps. The idea is to boost
              humans’ strength, increasing their
              capacity to carry heavy weight. Despite
              their potential, IFR’s estimates
              for this category are moderate:
              6,000 powered human exoskeletons
              units had been sold as of 2017,
              and IFR forecasts that only another
              48,000 units will have been sold
              by 2021. The technology is quite
              new. Currently, the primary field of
              applications is rehabilitation. Application
              areas for use of powered
              exoskeletons (for lower or upper
              extremities) have been documented

          <h4 class="subheading">Automation cells and solutions</h4>
          <div class="subheadingtext">
            <div class="inner-text">
              <p>Industrial robots are used in an
                increasing variety of structures and
                are often employed in complete
                automation systems, which consist
                of a multitude of industrial robots.
                Today, individual robots are applied
                as a “next step” in automation, for
                example, for unloading a finished
                part from a machine tool and afterwards
                loading a blank part ready
                for processing. A “second step” in
                automation are production cells,
                where a robot has been set up for
                unloading and loading several machines
                but was designed as a cell
                from scratch. These cells are often
                subsets of full production lines and
                sold through integrators to the customer.
                Robotics OEMs offer turnkey
                cells, including robotic arms,
                delivery systems such as adhesive
                dispensers, cell controllers (typically
                PLC), and safety equipment
                for specific applications. The aim
                is to deliver a solution for the end
                user and reduce complexity for the
                end customer, who may not have
                the time or know-how internally. At
                the same time, increased standardization
                for the robotics OEM can
                lower the cost of systems through
                common solutions. Whether this
                approach will be successful remains
                to be seen. Solutions, often highly
                customer specific, include different
                robots and cells. Typical examples
                of automation solutions can be
                found in automotive (e.g., body in
                white or paint production lines). Another
                example is electronics, where
                production is highly automated and
                takes place in lights-out, clean-room
                environments.</p>
