              Todays innovations in <b>industrial
                automation</b> are largely
              focused on interconnectivity.
              Powerful new technologies provide
              industry professioal with unprecedented
              abilities to see what is
              happening and respond in real-time.
              New tech is being dveloped for
              training, to bridge the skills gap and
              provide you with the knowledgeable
              workforce you need. And AI is
              improving everything from preventive
              maintenance to cybersecurity.
              These advanced technologies rely
              upon well-designed infrastructure
              and progressive leadership. “To be

                (around 1G/second) and a broadening

                infrastructure of satellites, cell

              <p>The Industrial Internet of Things
                (IIoT) refers to the interconnectivity
                of devices, and it is becoming
                increasingly relevant in all industries.
                Advancements in sensors
                and interconnects enable objects
                to send communications to users
                without them having to be onsite.
                And devices can operate on internet
                and GPS connectivity to inform their
                behavior. The IIoT has become essential
                for the agricultural industry,
                for example, as they rely on GPS to
                guide their tractors and imbedded
                sensors to remotely inform farmers
                of everything from fuel to harvest
                quantities.Other exapmle of agricultural
                examples of agricultural
                applications include sensors

              <p>The IIoT enables original equipment
                manufacturers (OEMs) to
                service and maintain their equipment
                remotely. In a world where
                tech is developing faster than the
                workforce is able to be trained,
                having OEMs take care of their own
                equipment is a dream come true for many industry professionals.
                In some cases, the equipment is
                effectively rented from the OEM. In
                other cases, when the assets are
                purchased by the company using
                them, the user pays a subscription
                to have the OEM provide monitoring,
                maintenance and repair.While this approach of outsourcing asset
                management to the OEMs, some
                voices caution that OEMs may
                focus too much on risk management
                for their companys sake and
                not focus enough on maximizing the

                In addition, blockchain technology
                enables producers to keep a clear
                and static log of their transactions
                or uses of an item. Digital transformation
                in all its forms is set to be
                the focus for the foreseeable future.
                Implementing these tech advancements
                in your company requires
                not only the intellectual knowledge
                but also the infrastructure to support
                your tech. NAI provides custom
                cable assemblies and cable
                harnesses to power, communicate
                and share data from your specialized
                tech, as well as with sensors,
                control panels and more. They’ve
                been able to keep up with the tech
                advancements developed over the
                past several decades, and they
                have the personnel and production facilities to keep up with the advancements
                you want to implement
                today.</p>
