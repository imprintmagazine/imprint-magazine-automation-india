            <h3>History</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>Infocast systems Pvt Ltd was incorporated in 2005 incorporating the assets of Studio Systems, a
                partnership firm that created the PALM Expo in 2001, as a result of publishing Playback And Fast Forward
                since 1986, which titled Studio Systems in 1992.</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Anil Chopra founder of India’s first professional pro audio magazine in 1986 that effectually developed
              music business in India. Playback And Fast Forward editorial focused on Music Recording Studio technology
              and expertise guided by India’s most famous Recording engineer Daman Sood, who himself set new paradigm of
              recording arts and expertise at Western Outdoor Studios. Music business too expanded to hundreds of new
              born record labels with the advent of Compact Cassette. Playback and Fast Forward became the source for
              all technology for music recording and production of media. Copyright and piracy forced the magazine to
              focus only on technology, which was a blessing in disguise. In 1992 Video recording and video publishing
              and broadcast revolution set in and Studio Systems which ushered in the compact cassette manufacturing
              revolution in transferring latest production information and contacts for mass production, once again was
              the primary source in ushering in the compact disc revolution in the country.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Thus in 1999 Studio Systems organises the first Optical Disc Technical Seminar series in the Taj Mahal
              Palace Hotel in Apollo Bundar, which led to the launch of trade expos in 2001- Replication Asia in New
              Delhi at the Taj Mahal Palace convention centre, Dhaula Kuan.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>This was followed by the pro audio industry represented by sound engineers led by Daman Sood to establish
              a dedicated Pro Audio expo since at that point India had just the Broadcast India expo which did not
              satisfy the pro sound industry. Since Infocast Systems was the only publisher in India since 1986
              publishing a pro audio magazine the professional fraternity felt it our responsibility to organise India’s
              first Pro Audio Expo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The founder Anil Chopra created the acronym PALM – Pro Audio Live [sound] Music [production]. The first
              PALM was held at Nehru Centre in Mumbai alongwith Cinema India. The mix was electric and succeeded in
              establishing the expos for a nascent industry. Returning from a trip attending the Replitech expo at the
              Hong Kong Convention Centre the founder visited the Cinema theatre expo organised concurrently at another
              level. On returning to India the sense of dynamism and sense of purpose in pushing new technology in audio
              and video Cinema India was born as a twin of PALM Expo.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Soon the stable of magazines included the gamut of technologies in audio and video recording and media.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Studio Systems for video and broadcast</li>
              <li>Pro Sound Systems for pro audio and live sound</li>
              <li>Cinema Systems for cinema projection and multiplex technology</li>
              <li>Optical Disc Systems for CD, DVD, optical storage</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>“Information Casting was the mantra for development of Indian media industries in adopting high-tech and
              investing in establishing a robust economy in production of audio video content and media” stated Anil
              Chopra, Editor of all Infocast magazines and founder of trade expos, awards, seminars, summits,
              conference.</p>

            <p>Infocast and its various media have played the role of catalyst in ushering in the revolutions in music
              business, music media such as compact cassette, compact disc, digital cinema, multiplex revolution, pro
              sound and lighting industry for stage and install, recording studios and video production. All this from
              1986-2009.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In 2010 all media assets were sold to Diversified Communication India, a US trade show organiser.</p>
